# The analysis results in this file have been extracted from a superset of the
#
#   Multi-INstrument Burst ARchive (MINBAR) data release 1
#
# comprising analyses of thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts observed by
# the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), BeppoSAX, and INTEGRAL.
#
# The data has been generated by a query from the web interface at
#
#   http://burst.sci.monash.edu
#
# Some of the data provided here may be PRELIMINARY and NOT SUITABLE FOR 
# PUBLICATION. For the definitive version of the analysis results comprising
# data release 1, download the machine-readable tables available at

#
# The last comment line before the data gives the column field names, which
# are also described below:
#   time = Burst start time (MJD UT)
#   bfluen = Bolometric fluence (integrated bolometric flux), E_b
#   bfluene = Uncertainty on bolometric fluence
#   alpha = Ratio of integrated persistent flux to burst fluence, alpha
#   alphae = Uncertainty on alpha
#   perflx = Persistent 3-25 keV flux prior to the burst, F_per
#   perflxe = Uncertainty on persistent flux
#   name = Likely burst origin
#   tdel = Time since previous burst from this source
#   tau = Ratio of fluence to peak flux, tau
#   taue = Uncertainty on tau
#   bc = Bolometric correction adopted for persistent flux
#   bce = Uncertainty on bolometric correction
#
